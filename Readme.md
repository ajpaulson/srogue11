# Srogue11

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ajpaulson/srogue11.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ajpaulson/srogue11)

This project is an attempt to refactor [Super Rogue](https://github.com/roguelikerestorationproject/srogue) so that it meets C11 standard and compiles cleanly with clang.

I will most likely migrate it from Make to Cmake in this process.
